# Final Project

Project Proposal:

Basic health tracker

## What is it

An application that allows users to login and record their weight, Blood Pressure, Heart Rate and hours of Sleep.
It will use node.js, express.js, MongoDb, and Jest.js for unit testing.
Depends on the access level, basic users can access only the weight tracker, and premium users can access the other trackers.

The application will have signup, login and use middleware to determine the access level of service.
I will use what we learned in the class to improve the above steps.

## Routes
for routes, it will have:
signup post
login post
change password put
enter health data post
update health data put
delete health data delete
Get health data get

## Models
for data model:
We will have 

user
Health record which will have the all the data.
I'll still deciding if I should have a big colleciton of documents that has all the fields or put the data in indivdual collections like weight, BP, HR, and Hour of sleep.

## Time

I'm planning to trying to wrap up the coding in the next 2 weekends and finish it by 6/6. I'm expecting to spend time to get my environment setup.
The week after I will complete the unit test to cover my code and be done with it.
I'll use the last week to check if I miss anything.
